1. #Seg3.png
-Model created correct bounding boxes around the image described in the prompt.
-Segmentation task partially masked the sliced plantain.
-Different prompts such as "A ripped plantain" only segmentated the plantain to the right. Lighting condition (shadow casted in the middle of the image) is to blame for this occurence.
-Current prompt used for Seg3 is, "A sliced plantain" with class "plantain"
-The model also included a strawberry image on the serving plate to its segmentation task, which makes seg3 inaccurate.

-GroundingDINO correctly created the bounding box around the mango.
-Prompt used is "A sliced mango" with class "Mango".
-MobileSAM partially segmentated the sliced mango. Holes are seen around the top left of the bounding box created by GorundingDINO.


3. #Seg9.png
-GroundingDINO did not create a bounding box around the third kenkey in the image. 
-MobileSAM ignored the third kenkey as a result of GroundingDINO not creating bounding box around it.
-Bounding box around Tilapia and pepper stew were correct. However, segmentation on the pepper stew wasn't done properly.The Next task is to try different prompts to analyse different segmentation results on this particular image.
