-Model created correct bounding boxes around the image described in the prompt.
-Segmentation task partially masked the sliced plantain.
-Different prompts such as "A ripped plantain" only segmentated the plantain to the right. Lighting condition (shadow casted in the middle of the image) is to blame for this occurence.
-Current prompt used for Seg3 is, "A sliced plantain" with class "plantain"
-The model also included a strawberry image on the serving plate to its segmentation task, which makes seg3 inaccurate.
